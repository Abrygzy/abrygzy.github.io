My name is Zeyu Gao (高泽宇). I am a PhD student in the [Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn/)/[KIAA](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am working with [Prof. Yingjie Peng](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/info/1010/1016.htm) on the topics of understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies through their SEDs. We developed a new SED fitting code with physical priors of evolution history information from cosmological hydrosimulations.

I am also interested in understanding galaxies through spatially resolved view. I worked with [Prof. Yanmei Chen](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/szll/szgk/js/20190816/i13833.html) with breathtakingly beautiful [MaNGA](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/manga/) data. We found observational clues for different quenching mechanisms in the local universe.
