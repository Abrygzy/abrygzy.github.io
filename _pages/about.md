Notice that this website is still under construction. I will update it as soon as possible.

I am a PHD student in the [Department of Astronomy](http://vega.bac.pku.edu.cn/)/[KIAA](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am working with [Prof. Yingjie Peng](https://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/info/1010/1016.htm) on the topics of understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies through their SEDs.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
